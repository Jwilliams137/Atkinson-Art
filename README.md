This website was built using Next.js, Cloudinary, and Firebase to showcase the art of Linda Atkinson. It's designed with an admin page where content can be uploaded making it easy to display and update.  It has been renovated for deployment on Netlify.

## Getting Started

First do an npm install and then run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
